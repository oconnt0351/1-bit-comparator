## How it works

Two input switches' values are compared to each other. An LED lights up with the resulting comparison.

## How to test

Red LED should light up if first input is high and second is low, Yellow if both are high or low, and Green if the second is high while the first is low.

## External hardware

3 LEDs are used for output.
